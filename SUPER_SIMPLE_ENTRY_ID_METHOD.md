# Super Simple Way to Find Entry IDs

## Method: Fill Out Your Form and Check the URL

### Step 1: Open Your Google Form
Go to: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenckW5me1StAROhe0VSEgcMH3Y0XVEYETbbdZPVrFSHxCBeQ/viewform

### Step 2: Fill Out the Form
Fill in some test data:
- Name: Test Name
- Restaurant Name: Test Restaurant
- Designation: Test Role
- Location: Test City
- Contact Number: 1234567890
- Email: test@test.com
- Message: Test message

### Step 3: Submit the Form
Click "Submit"

### Step 4: Check What Happens
After submitting, one of these will happen:
1. You'll see a "Thank you" page
2. You might see a URL with parameters
3. The form might redirect somewhere

### Step 5: Check Your Form Responses
1. Go back to your Google Form
2. Click the "Responses" tab
3. See if your test data appeared

If the data appeared, that means your form is working and we just need to try different entry ID patterns.
