# Testing Your Google Form Integration

## âœ… Your Form is Now Connected!

I've updated your contact form with your Google Form details:
- **Form ID**: `1FAIpQLSenckW5me1StAROhe0VSEgcMH3Y0XVEYETbbdZPVrFSHxCBeQ`
- **Action URL**: Connected to your Google Form

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Step 1: Test the Website Form
1. Go to your website contact form
2. Fill it out with test data
3. Submit it
4. Check if data appears in your Google Form responses

### Step 2: Check Google Form Responses
1. Open your Google Form
2. Click the **"Responses"** tab
3. Look for your test submission

### Step 3: Link to Google Sheets (Recommended)
1. In your Google Form, click **"Responses"** tab
2. Click the **Google Sheets icon** ðŸ“Š
3. Create new spreadsheet: "Scandalous Foods Leads"
4. All future submissions will appear here automatically

## ðŸ”§ If Data Doesn't Appear

The entry IDs I used are educated guesses. If the form doesn't work:

1. **Try the View Source method**:
   - Right-click on your form â†’ "View Page Source"
   - Search for `entry.` to find the real entry IDs
   - Let me know what you find

2. **Or we can use trial and error**:
   - Submit a test form
   - Check what data appears (if any)
   - Adjust the entry IDs accordingly

## ðŸ“§ Email Backup

Even if Google Forms doesn't work immediately, the email backup will still open with all the form data, so no leads will be lost!

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Testing

Once the form is working:
1. âœ… Set up Google Sheets integration
2. âœ… Configure email notifications  
3. âœ… Set up Bigin CRM integration (optional)
4. âœ… Start capturing leads automatically!

Try submitting a test form now and let me know what happens!
